Welcome to Yifan's personal website that doubled as a digital ~~garden~~ paper piles.

Good seismologist, bad coder. Likes tinkering stuff. Can't help but press "update" every time.
Just defended my Ph.D at ETH Zürich and became a gig scientist.

Full CV can be [[notes/Curriculum Vitae|found here]] and as a [PDF file](https://yifanyin.github.io/yifans_cv_2022.pdf).
