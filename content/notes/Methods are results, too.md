How can we make geophysics
1. Value methods as a scientific achievement, and
2. Value open-sourced codes as important scientific contributions?

Time and time again, I hear people say that “you gotta push for the science!”, or “implementing methods will take out too much time, and you won't have enough publications!.” I disagree. I think this mentality makes geoscience so far behind in terms of technology and reproducibility.
