> Choosing a model is the same as choosing a base functions. It's the wavelength you choose to observe and describe the phenomena.

Simulation science, computational physics, scientific computation, you name it.

I should start by saying that I am still a total n00b to the concept and philosophy of numerical simulation. I was drown to the concept of inversion during my [[notes/prj-banana-donut|master project]], without realizing that invert a model using data also means you assume a physical model that can produce a prediction. See, regress the data point with a straight line requires you to assume that the relation between two quantity is linear. So forward and inverse are ying and yang.
