# Neuroscience Protocols
- Duration, path and outcome
    - Our brains always try to figure out these three things. Making clear of these aspect make us feel more assured and calm.

# Best time to exercise
-   When the drive to exercise is the highest: when the slope of body temperature change is the steepest
    -   30 min after waking
    -   3 hr after waking
    -   When temperature peaks
    -   And ~11 hrs after waking

# Circadian rhythm
- wakefulness and sleepiness
     - Get as much sunlight when you want to be awake
         - Better get up before 9AM and get enough light in your eyes _outside._
         - Get some sunset light to calibrate the eyes.
    - Get as little as possible when you want to sleep (10PM-4AM)
    - Light and body temperature are the most important factor

# Better daily routine
- Get morning light outside when you wake up
- Get sunset
- Keep the blue light up
- Delay coffee intake until two hours after waking up
- Try exercise in the morning, around 1 hr after waking up.

# Jet lag
- It'll get worse as we age
- Start adjusting earlier if you are traveling east. Because getting up earlier is the worst!
- Fix exercise schedule helps with shifting the jet lag.
- Temperature minimum
    -   Is the point when your body temperature tend to be 90min-2hrs before wake time.
    -   View bright light, eating, exercise 4-6 hour after TM will advance your body clock.
    -   View bright light 4-6 hours, eat, exercise before TM, it shifts later.
    -   For example, morning cold shower raise your temperature after.
