# Catalogs
- [Harvard globalcentroid moment tensor catalog](https://www.globalcmt.org)
    - CMT solutions of global earthquakes M>5.
- [The ISC-GEM catalog](https://www.globalcmt.org) 
    - 1904-2018, magnitude 5 and above for continental region and 5.5 for the rest.

# Scaling laws

## [[notes/magnitude-frequency distribution|Magnitude-frequency distribution]]

## Omori-Utsu law
rate of aftershocks as a function of time t from the main-shock decays as $$\lambda(t)=K(t+c)^{-p}$$c, p: parameters

# Statistical terms
- aleatory
	- random
- epistemic
	- relating to the knowledge or the degree of its validation

## coefficient of variation
- $C_V=\sigma/\mu$
- where $\sigma$ and $\mu$ are standard deviation and average of the inter-event time
- The measurement is common for paleoseismology studies.
