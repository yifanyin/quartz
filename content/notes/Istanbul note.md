- The best part of Istanbul is not Hagia Sofia, but the vast wall of Constantinople.
- The traffic, the crappy sidewalks and the mad jaywalking skills all remind me of my home 20 years ago.
- The Constantinople part of the city is practically destroyed by the tourism, so are the Grand Bazaar and the Egyptian Bazaar. Probably because of the overwhelming tourists, the city doesn't even bother to create a tourism website that offers decent guides to the travelers.
- Rice dishes are surprisingly good in Turkey. Pilaf is originated in Iran and is an ancient dish popular throughout the Western Asia and Europe. Turkish put rice in meatballs, bell peppers and mussels.
