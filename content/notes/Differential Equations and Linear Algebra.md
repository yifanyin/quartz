So I promised that I would watch Gilbert Strang's classes to bring good luck to the postdoc.mobility grant. Now that I get it, I have to study and refresh my rusty math.

# Notes
## The calculus you need
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0BxAtprWts)
> At the end, a useful formula in differential equations is confirmed by the product rule, the derivative of $e^x$, and the fundamental theorem of calculus (4)
> The key step in scientific computing is improving first order accuracy (forward differences) to second order accuracy (centered differences). For integrals, rectangle rules improve to trapezoidal rules. This is a big step to good algorithms (7)

## Linear algebra
It turned out my linear algebra is even more rusty
