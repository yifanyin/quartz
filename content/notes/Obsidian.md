- Pros
    - totally offline.
    - the notes are in markdown so everything is transferable except very few added-on flavors.
    - [Basic Formatting and only Roam Research  EDN import](../../Stuff/smart notes/Athens Research/Cons/Basic Formatting and only Roam Research  EDN import.md) 
    - Very fancy graphs and other powerful functions such as tag search.
    - [tags and pages are separated.](../smart notes/Obsidian/Cons/tags and pages are separated.md) 
    - Large user base and many plug-ins
    - Popular among academia
    - $25 one-time
- Cons
    - Not as fluid as [Roam Research ](../../Stuff/smart notes/Roam Research.md) or [Athens Research](../../Stuff/smart notes/Athens Research.md) that has bullets as the minimum note unit.
    - Closed-source
    - Switching between markdown and viewing mode actually make the reading process hard. One lose track of what you are reading. I think the WYSIWYG interface really wins. Making the font the same with iAWriter's font somewhat help.
    - tags and pages are separated.
