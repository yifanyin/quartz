# SHERIFS: Open-Source Code for Computing Earthquake Rates in Fault Systems and Constructing Hazard Models
- Authors: Thomas Chartier, Oona Scotti, and Hélène Lyon-Caen
- [Source code](https://github.com/tomchartier/SHERIFS)

## Notes
- Seismic Hazard and Earthquake Rates In Fault Systems
- Adapt the main philosophy of [[notes/UCERF3|UCERF3]]

### Inputs
- Fault geometry and basic descriptions
- Target [[notes/statistical seismology#Magnitude-frequency distribution|magnitude-frequency distribution]] shape of fault seismicity
    - This is expressed as the **ratio** of magnitudes occurring in the background hypothesis input.
