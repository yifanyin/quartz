From a blog post of BOCCA coffee that is now lost

- Using ratio of 75g of coffee per 1000g of brewing water (1:13.3) + 285g ice added after brewing.
- Brewing coffee dose of 75g on finer grind size with 1000g of water should have TDS = 1.8%, which means that extraction is about 20.5%. To bring the TDS down to 1.4 we must add 285g of ice.
- Depending on how much of the final Flash Brew youâ€™d like to make, you can adjust the amount of dose, brewing water and ice, while keeping the ratio the same. Grind size will be different though! For example:
    - Dose: 15g, brewing water: 200g, ice: 57g
    - Dose: 75g, brewing water: 1000g, ice: 285g
    - Dose: 150g, brewing water: 2000g, ice: 570g
- Grind your coffee dose on a grind setting that gives you TDS of 1.8%
- after brewing. use a refractometer to check the TDS value. Add 285g of ice and mix it thoroughly until all the ice is completely melted. TDS of this beverage should be 1.4%. Pour it into bottles, label them and chill them (shelf life is 3 days).
