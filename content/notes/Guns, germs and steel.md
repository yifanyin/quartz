# Notes
The big mammals in Africa likely evolve with the proto-humans so that they are not killed off. Humans can then domesticate large mammals as an extra power. When humans spread to North America, Australia, and [New Zealand](../../New Zealand.md), they likely killed off the unprepared large animals and lost the possibility of domestication and advancing in technology.
