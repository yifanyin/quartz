# Catalogs
- [Harvard globalcentroid moment tensor catalog](https://www.globalcmt.org)
    - CMT solutions of global earthquakes M>5.
- [The ISC-GEM catalog](https://www.globalcmt.org) 
    - 1904-2018, magnitude 5 and above for continental region and 5.5 for the rest.

# Scaling laws
## [[magnitude-frequency distribution]]

## Omori-Utsu law
The frequency of aftershocks per unit time interval
- t: time since mainshock
- c, p: parameters

rate of aftershocks 
$$\lambda(t)=K(t+c)^{-p}$$
$$K = f(M_c)$$
$$n(t) = \frac{K}{(t+c)^p}$$ ^64h6vmC1c

# Statistical terms
- aleatory
	- random
- epistemic
	- relating to the knowledge or the degree of its validation

## coefficient of variation
- $C_V=\sigma/\mu$
- where $\sigma$ and $\mu$ are standard deviation and average of the inter-event time
- The measurement is common for paleoseismology studies.

## Likelihood, maximum likelihood and getting b-values and Mc.
[The principle of maximum likelihood](https://www.otexts.org/1437)
[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test)
Compare a sample with a reference probability distribution
