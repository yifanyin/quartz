I wouldn't say that I am good at math. Although I attended the most math-heavy program in geoscience you could find in Taiwan. Then I went for a doctorate after working for several years. The rusty math somehow didn't hold me back, and I pimp up some cool result that was enough for graduation. The second part of the thesis finally seriously challenged my resourcefulness. It was a solid simulation work! I could barely hold the work together if not for the help from Elias, the postdoc that was helping me. That got me thinking
1. How come there was no training on simulation science in geosciences?
2. How come I can survive with this little theoretical knowledge? Is this the pitfall of geosciences?
3. Is this pitfall further deepened by the little emphasis of [[notes/Methods are results, too|method development]]?

With this doubt, I was granted a postdoc fellowship to do the exact thing I doubted about myself so much (what the hell). The in-between time I spend on refreshing my math. As a prom
