The third Uniform California Earthquake **Rupture Forecast** (UCERF3) is the PSHA model of California. But because of the extensive fault and seismicity data available, the model is able to present the possible ruptures instead of low-activity area that rely on magnitude-frequency relations to estimate the hazard.
