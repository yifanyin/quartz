# The Gutenberg-Richter law
The probability of an event with Magnitude Mag that is larger than M is
$$Pr\{Mag>M\} = e^{-\beta M}$$
Or in logarithmic form
$$\log_{10}F(M) = a-bM$$

# The moment-frequency relations
- Note that MFD can have very different shape depending on the target. For example, the MFD of a fault or the MFD of a subduction zone can be very different from the Gutenberg-Richter relation.
- And there is a upper bound of maximum magnitude because of the length of plate boundary and the seismogenic thickness. How does GR relation taper? (Kagen, 2002a, 2002b)
- [[notes/PSHA|PSHA]] looks at the FMD of declustered catalogs. [[notes/Question|Question]]: *Does declustered catalogs have substantially different MFD?*
