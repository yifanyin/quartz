Back when I started the [[notes/prj-eqsim|fault system simulations]] as one of the PhD projects, there are not many open-sourced tools to start from. Software programs in geophysics always stays within labs. The only way to get a hold of them is through connection. Luckily, there are still platforms and several packages that open up for public to use. There is [[notes/Virtual Quake|Virtual Quake]] for earthquake simulator. Then there is [[notes/QDYN|QDYN]] for quasi-dynamic fault rupture simulations. Fast-forward to present-day, there are more and more stuff available, such as HBI and EQDyna.

However, recently, I came to realize that simply advancing the capabilities of numerical simulations does not earn you [[notes/My Hero Academics|hero credits]] towards academic glories. In my field, we need (ahem) “science” instead of advancing tools and methods. Theories? maybe. Methods? meh. But hell yeah ground-breaking observations. Some researchers I admire are still fighting for tenure. Others left all the incredible work in their thesis and went for industry or national labs. I think this is an immense loss for the geophysics and seismology as a whole.

How can we make geophysics
1. Value methods as a scientific achievement, and
2. Value open-sourced codes as important scientific contributions?

# Full cycle of open data
- The **FAIR** principle: **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, **R**eusable

## Methods are results, too
