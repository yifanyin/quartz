# How to achieve earthquake forecasts?
Earthquake weather? Earthquake climate? What do we need to do next?
- Physics-based models capable of [[notes/data assimilation|data assimilation]]
- good approximation of the physics we want to model
- upscaling?

# Current state-of-the-art forecasting tools
There are two main methods of forecasting earthquakes and/or aftershocks
## [[notes/ETAS|ETAS]] and other statistic or ML models
- [[@Hardebeck2021-hl]] 

## [[Coulomb rate-and-state model|CRS]] models with "physics-based" rate estimation
- [[@Dieterich1994-rd]]
- [[Cattania.SRL.2018.CRS]]
- [[Mancini.JGR.2019]]

## advanced traffic light system?

# Operational Earthquake Forecasting
- [[GNS Science]]

# Other fields to learn from
- Weather and climate models
    - Straight-foreward physics of water vapor and atmosphere convection
    - Sate 
- Induced seismicity in reservoir operations
    - Thermal-hydro-mechenical-chemical models
- Volcano monitoring
    - Lots of different data types like gas, deformation, seismicity. temperature. 
- Building health monitoring
