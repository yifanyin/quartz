# Inverse matrices
Suppose $A$ is a square matrix, we can look for its inverse $A^{-1}$ ("A inverse").
> [!note]
> 1. Not all matrices have inverses
> 2. The inverse of a sparse matrix is generally a full matrix

Calculating inverse matrices are expensive because we are actually solving $n$ equations.

# Symmetric and orthogonal matrices
When rows of A become the columns of $A^T$ ("A Transpose") and the columns of A become the rows of $A^T$.

> [!Rules for transpose]
> 1. The transpose of $AB$ is $B^TA^T$
> 2. The transpose of $A^{-1}$ is $(A^{-1})^T=(A^T)^{-1}$ 

> [!Note]
> 1. Symmetric matrices $S^T=S$, $S$ is square and $s_{ij}=s_{ji}$
> They have real eigenvalues $\lambda$ and orthogonal eigenvectors $x$
> 2. Orthogonal matrix $Q^T=Q^{-1}$. $Q$ is square and $Q^TQ=I$
