# Basic
## UCL Catastrophe modeling lecture
1. Hazard → intensity
2. Vulnerability → probability of damage fragility curve
3. Exposure
4. Loss

- Stocks tic simulations of all possible scenarios
- How to communicate the cat models. Uncertainties
- Probability of excellence More useful of managing losses. 
    Inverse: return-period loss
- Emergency responses from CAT models. 
- CAT model firms sell their models to insurance and reinsurance firms. → How to help NG0S to access EAT models?
    Scaled-down models or crosse models

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_insurance)
**Parametric insurance** (also called [index-based insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index-based_insurance "Index-based insurance")) is a non-traditional insurance product that offers pre-specified payouts based upon a trigger event.([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_insurance#cite_note-:0-1)) Trigger events depend on the nature of the parametric policy and can include environmental triggers such as wind speed and rainfall measurements, business-related triggers such as foot traffic,([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_insurance#cite_note-2)) and more
