title: Hello World!
---
Welcome to Yifan's personal website that doubled as a digital ~~garden~~ rewilding yard.

I am a seismologist morphed into a structural geologist, bad coder. I like tinkering with stuff, whether it's a piece of code, a bike, or a sourdough recipe.
After defending my thesis at ETH ZÃ¼rich, I am currently an SNF postdoc.mobility fellow at MIT EAPS.

Full CV can be [[notes/Curriculum Vitae|found here]] and as a [PDF file](https://yifanyin.github.io/yifans_cv_2022.pdf).
