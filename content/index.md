title: Hello World!

Welcome to Yifan's personal website that doubled as a digital ~~garden~~ rewilding yard.

I am a seismologist morphed into a structural geologist, bad coder, and bike commuter. I like tinkering with stuff, whether it's a piece of code, a bike, or a sourdough recipe.

After defending my thesis at ETH ZÃ¼rich, I am currently an SNF postdoc.mobility fellow at MIT EAPS.

Full CV can be [[Curriculum Vitae|found here]] and as a [PDF file](https://yifanyin.github.io/yifans_cv_2022.pdf).

- Learn how to drive.

# Master and PhD Projects
- [[Seismic Tomography]]
- [[Crustal strain and seismicity]]
- [[Simulate earthquake sequences in 3-D fault systems]]

# Personal Interests
- [[Better built environments]]
