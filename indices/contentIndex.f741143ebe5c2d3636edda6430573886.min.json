The objective is to find the time at which each source in the population initiates an earthquake by following the evolution of conditions on the sources when subjected to some stressing history.\n   - Here the volume containing the sources is assumed to be small enough to undergo the same stressing history.\n   - The time of nucleation $t = F[C, \\tau(t)]$. C is the initial condition and $\\tau(t)$ is the stressing history.\n   - At each time step, C is reevaluated using the prior stressing history and the state distribution.\n\nAssume the initial condition is under a reference constant stressing rate $\\dot\\tau_r$ and generate constant seismicity rate $r$\n- The time when $n^{th}$ event occur: $$t = n/r = F[C, \\tau_r] \\tag{1;2}$$\n- So, $C = C(n, r, \\dot\\tau_r)$ (3)\n- and $t = F[C(n, r, \\dot\\tau_r), \\tau(t)]$ (4)\n\n### Rate-and-state friction incoming\n- [[notes/Dieterich-Tectonophysics-1992|Dieterich1992]]\n- Link the [[notes/rate-and-state friction|rate-and-state friction]] using $\\tau$\n\n$$\\tau=\\sigma[\\mu_0+A\\ln(\\frac{\\dot\\sigma}{\\dot\\sigma^*})+ B_1\\ln(\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta^*_1})+B_2\\ln(\\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta^*_2})+...] \\tag{5}$$\n\n$$d\\theta_i = [\\frac{1}{\\dot\\delta} - \\frac{\\theta_i}{Dc}]d\\sigma - [\\frac{\\alpha_i\\theta_i}{B_i\\sigma}]d\\sigma$$\n\nState change with 1. aging law and 2. normal stress law from Linker and Dieterich, 1992.\n\n## Appendix A: Earthquake nucleation\nThe author reiterates the $L_c$ and said empirical evaluation of the size of the nucleation zone from the numerical models gives $\\xi$ ~ 0.4B.\n\nSimulations of faults with heterogeneous properties show that:\n- The zone of most rapid acceleration tends to shrink to a characteristic fault length of $L_c$ (Appendix A, equation (A2)) as the time of instability approaches.\n- Nucleation sources of length $L_c$ develop spontaneously in regions where the shear stress relative to the sliding resistance averaged over $L_c$ is higher than the surroundings.\n\nIn general, slip speed is determined by the independent variables $\\theta$, $\\tau$, and $\\sigma$. It is shown in Appendix A that in an accelerating slip patch evolution of $\\theta$ is determined by slip. Under this condition, the dependence of the time to instability on initial conditions is fully specified by the initial slip speed ${\\dot\\delta}_0$ of the patch (Appendix A, equation (A7)).\n\n$$\\dot\\delta_0 = (\\theta_{o_1}^{-B_1/A}\\theta_{o_2}^{-B2/A}...)exp(\\frac{\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\sigma}-\\mu'_0}{A}) \\tag{A7}$$\n\nThe distribution of initial slip speed is (7). The form remains when time progress.\n$$\\dot\\delta(n) = [H\\sigma\\gamma(exp(\\frac{\\dot\\tau_r n}{A\\sigma\\tau})-1)]^{-1} \\tag{7}$$\n\n$$H = \\frac{B}{D_c} - \\frac{k}{\\sigma}$$ ^ZBlaLBaW9\n\nInitially, $$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\dot\\tau_r} \\tag{8}$$ where $\\tau_r$ is the reference shear stress. $\\gamma$ is a state variable that evolves with time and stressing history. Essentially, the seismicity rate is controlled only by the stressing rate.\n\nThe state variable evolves with time as\n\n$$d\\gamma = \\frac{1}{A\\sigma}[dt - \\gamma d\\tau + \\gamma(\\frac{\\tau}{\\sigma} - \\alpha)d\\sigma] \\tag{9}$$^Dieterich1994-9\n\n- The steady-state solution goes back to (8)\n- $A$ generally has values between 0.005-0.012 ^jN7GXVW6b\n- These equations reproduce Omori's law of aftershock decay with 1/time.\n- At steady state\n$$\\gamma_{ss} = \\frac{1}{\\dot\\tau}; t_a = \\frac{A\\sigma}{\\dot\\tau} \\tag{10}$$\n- Seismicity rate $R = \\frac{r}{\\gamma\\dot\\tau_r}$. $r$ is the reference seismicity rate.

Field\n- Journal: SRL Opinion\n\n## Abstract\nQuestions have persisted on the usefulness of physics-based earthquake simulators with respect to forecasting earthquakes, due mostly to the inevitable assumptions, approximations, and uncertainties. Whether any model is reliable or trustworthy depends entirely on what questions we are asking of it, so the point of this article is to outline a number of currently anticipated and desired inferences, informed largely by recent forecasting efforts in California. This article does not provide an in-depth review of physics-based simulators, nor does it render judgment on the usefulness question. The intent, rather, is to provide an explicit list of potential uses, or inferences, to enable more informed discussions among physics-based modeling experts.\n\n## Notes\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-20T20:06:16.192640393Z","tags":null},"/notes/Gerstenberger-RevGeophys-2020":{"title":"Gerstenberger-RevGeophys-2020","content":"\n# Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis at Regional and National Scales: State of the Art and Future Challenges\n- **Authors**: M.

Through much of this belt, the topography is created and controlled by fault movement in earthquakes. Many habitations are located at the foot of the fault-controlled mountain range-fronts that bound inhospitable deserts or elevated plateaus, in positions that are favourable for trade-routes, strategic control of access or for water supply. As a result, they are vulnerable to earthquakes, which often seem to have targeted population centres precisely.\n\nFor many centuries, an uneasy accommodation was reached between human needs and the earthquake-controlled landscape, sometimes brilliantly exploited by local hydrological engineering, as in Iran. Occasional earthquakes would occur, killing a shocking proportion of the population, but the populations of the settlements themselves would be relatively small. Many once-small rural communities have now grown into towns, cities or megacities, while retaining their vulnerability through poor building standards. Earthquakes that occur in these places today now kill many more than they did in the past, as we have witnessed in the last few years. Extreme catastrophes have been rare only because the exposure of modern megacities to earthquake hazards has been relatively short (approx. 50 years); an increase in the number of such catastrophes now seems to be inevitable.\n\n## See also\n[[notes/prj-EMME23|EMME]]","lastmodified":"2022-09-20T20:06:16.192640393Z","tags":null},"/notes/James-H-Dieterich":{"title":"James H.

Loosely, PKM tools are referred to the note keeping apps that let you reference portions of the note I happened to try the famed web-based note service *Roam Research*. Roam is a \"outliner\", bit like *Workflowy* or *Dynalist*.  One writes in hierarchical bullet points, or outlines. This structure allows you to write in a more non-linear way. Each page and bullet has its own address and can be easily cited elsewhere. There are open-sourced alternatives that achieve similar noting experience: [Athens Research](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens) and [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq). Personally, I used Athens Research for my daily scribbles. Now I switch to [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com/) for better PDF integration.\n\nUsing these tools free me from the note black hole that is Evernote or random note pile that is Bear and allows me to recycle and cite my own note to write more. The blocks also nudge you to write freely without considering too much about structures. That you can drag and drop later.

Surely one can use the statistics to generate one. But we know plates move and faults slide. How do we incorporate these information when generating sequences?\n\nThe statistical route of generating synthetic seismicity is using the [[notes/ETAS|ETAS]] (epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model. ETAS relies on the scaling-law parameters that are fitted to real catalogs. Another more physical route is the cellular automata models commonly called the earthquake simulators. The earthquake simulators takes the fault geometries as the model mesh and simulate patch sliding and interactions just like what we imagine earthquakes do. Because the failure criterion is as simple as on-off switches, these models are very efficient for models with large degrees of freedom and a long simulated period. Better still, the event generated reproduce the power-law magnitude distribution seen in earthquake catalogs. But because the failure mechanisms are simple, the simulators do not recover the details of nucleation, propagation and finally arrest. The models that can do so solves the conservation equations using various numerical methods. These class of models are capable to reproduce rupture processes and even ground motions. However, they are computationally demanding, especially for multiple earthquake cycles. \n\nIs there a way for us greedy scientists to have both phenomena in one simulation? A model that solves the differential equations but also produces diverse events that compose frequency-magnitude distribution? In this project we achieve such simulations using appropriate frictional parameters, fault interactions, and a suitable solver to vastly improve the time-stepping efficiency of [[notes/QDYN|QDYN]], a rupture simulator. The result is a simple fault system that generate diverse earthquake sequence.\n\n![](notes/images/pap2_tweet.gif)\n\nOur result shows that with fault interaction that naturally exists within the crust, it's a lot easier to generate earthquake sequences that resemble real sequences, albeit that the maximum magnitude is bounded by the fault size. There are other factors we have yet to put in the model, such as heterogeneous frictional properties and non-planar fault planes. The result gives us chances to exam the effect of all these factors that create the statistical signatures of seismicity as we know it.\n\n# Perspectives\n- What does the distribution look like for seismicity generated on the same fault?

Both seismicity and geodetic data are readily available to us. But how does one translate to another?\n\nIn this project, we investigate if the subduction-zone events disturb the seismicity in three  region prior to the Canterbury earthquake sequence starting in 2010, in the South Island of New Zealand. The 2009 M7.8 [Dusky Sound earthquake](https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/story/3124785) is a subduction-zone event that deform large part of the South Island. Its coseismic slip and afterslip left profound footprint in the strain field on the South Island. \n\nThe strain field we resolve is not smooth at all. Does the uneven deformation affect the seismicity as well? Through theory, we know a change of stress will also change the earthquake productivity. To amplify the statistical significance of rate-change estimate from a sparsely instrumented region, we use the [[notes/template matching|template matching]] technique to discover small earthquakes that didn't reach the network detection threshold. Because there are few stations to constrain the detection quality, we add another layer of safety using a simple supervised learning method, [the support vector machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), to tease out false detections.\n\n![](notes/images/cumu_dila4.jpg)\n\nWe found that in the seismicity rate change positively correlate with the coseismic strain produced by the Dusky Sound earthquake. The NS extension slow down the earthquake productivity, likely also unclamp the EW Darfield rupture. The effect of strain field changing during the subduction zone events has large impact in low-strain area like the Canterbury Plain.
