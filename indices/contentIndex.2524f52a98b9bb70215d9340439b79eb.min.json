{"/":{"title":"🏔 Yifan Yin 🧑🏻‍💻","content":"\nWelcome to Yifan's personal website that doubled as a digital pile of notes.\n\n[⌨️ Notes](https://yifanyin.github.io/notes/)   [🗂Tags](https://yifanyin.github.io/tags/)\n\nI am a seismologist by training, but wandered across different fields of geophysics during my career. I am most fascinated by the way solid earth scientists pick up various signals from the seemingly chaos and turn them into knowledge. My trajectory mostly follow this line in spite the varied methods and models I use to understand the world.\n\nFull CV can be [[notes/Curriculum Vitae|found here]] and as a [PDF file](https://yifanyin.github.io/yifans_cv_2022.pdf).\n\n---\n## Professional Interests\nI am interested in the interplay of data and models. In seismology, this is especially challenging and fun because of the vast scale of space and time involved. My first love was seismic imaging and inversion that turns discrete phase arrival times into velocity models. Now I deal with earthquake statistics and ways to combine discrete earthquakes, segmented faults and continuous crustal deformation.\n\n### Master and PhD Projects\n- [[notes/prj-banana-donut.md|Seismic imaging]]\n- [[notes/prj-tempmatch.md|Crustal strain and seismicity]]\n- [[notes/prj-eqsim|Seismicity Simulations]]\n- 👉 [[notes/EMME23|Updating seismic hazard model in the Middle East]]\n\n### Technical experiences\n- Data analyst at the [Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology](https://bats.earth.sinica.edu.tw/) (BATS), Academia Sinica, Taiwan.\n    - Routine focal mechanism solutions and bulletins for noticeable loca earthquakes\n    - Database and metadata organization\n- Assistant researcher at [SinoTech Consultant](https://www.sinotech.org.tw/) on extreme weather events and landslide monitoring.\n\n## Personal Interests\n- [[notes/Better built environmemts|Sustainability in built environments]]\n- [Hiking](https://yifanyin.github.io/tags/hiking/), best perform in hot and humid jungles, but Alpine pasture with cow poops are not too bad, either.\n- [Cooking and coffee](https://yifanyin.github.io/tags/food-and-drink/)\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-01T15:31:44.510932866Z","tags":null},"/notes/A-Taiwanese-survival-guide-in-Switzerland":{"title":"A Taiwanese survival guide in Switzerland","content":"\n# Food\n- The soy milk in Migros is the best soy milk you can get.\n- The same applied to Migros' seiden tofu.\n- But Coop sells better firm tofu for stir-frys.\n- Do not attempt to eat the soymilk yogurt.\n- Swiss is famous for its chocolates.

The objective is to find the time at which each source in the population initiates an earthquake by following the evolution of conditions on the sources when subjected to some stressing history.\n\n   - Here the volume containing the sources is assumed to be small enough to undergo the same stressing history.\n   - The time of nucleation $t = F[C, \\tau(t)]$. C is the initial condition and $\\tau(t)$ is the stressing history.\n   - At each time step, C is reevaluated using the prior stressing history and the state distribution.\n\nAssume the initial condition is under a reference constant stressing rate $\\dot\\tau_r$ and generate constant seismicity rate $r$\n- The time when $n^{th}$ event occur: $$t = n/r = F[C, \\tau_r] \\tag{1;2}$$\n- So, $C = C(n, r, \\dot\\tau_r)$ (3)\n- and $t = F[C(n, r, \\dot\\tau_r), \\tau(t)]$ (4)\n\n## Rate-and-state friction incoming\n- [[notes/Dieterich.Tectonophysics.1992]]\n- Link the [[notes/rate-and-state friction|rate-and-state friction]] using $\\tau$\n\n$$\\tau=\\sigma[\\mu_0+A\\ln(\\frac{\\dot\\sigma}{\\dot\\sigma^*})+ B_1\\ln(\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta^*_1})+B_2\\ln(\\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta^*_2})+...] \\tag{5}$$\n\n$$d\\theta_i = [\\frac{1}{\\dot\\delta} - \\frac{\\theta_i}{Dc}]d\\sigma - [\\frac{\\alpha_i\\theta_i}{B_i\\sigma}]d\\sigma$$\n\nState change with 1. aging law and 2. normal stress law from Linker and Dieterich, 1992.\n\n## Appendix A: Earthquake nucleation\nThe author reiterates the $L_c$ and said empirical evaluation of the size of the nucleation zone from the numerical models gives $\\xi$ ~ 0.4B.\n\nSimulations of faults with heterogeneous properties show that:\n- The zone of most rapid acceleration tends to shrink to a characteristic fault length of $L_c$ (Appendix A, equation (A2)) as the time of instability approaches.\n- Nucleation sources of length $L_c$ develop spontaneously in regions where the shear stress relative to the sliding resistance averaged over $L_c$ is higher than the surroundings.\n\nIn general, slip speed is determined by the independent variables $\\theta$, $\\tau$, and $\\sigma$. It is shown in Appendix A that in an accelerating slip patch evolution of $\\theta$ is determined by slip. Under this condition, the dependence of the time to instability on initial conditions is fully specified by the initial slip speed ${\\dot\\delta}_0$ of the patch (Appendix A, equation (A7)).\n\n$$\\dot\\delta_0 = (\\theta_{o_1}^{-B_1/A}\\theta_{o_2}^{-B2/A}...)exp(\\frac{\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\sigma}-\\mu'_0}{A}) \\tag{A7}$$\n\nThe distribution of initial slip speed is (7). The form remains when time progress.\n$$\\dot\\delta(n) = [H\\sigma\\gamma(exp(\\frac{\\dot\\tau_r n}{A\\sigma\\tau})-1)]^{-1} \\tag{7}$$\n\n$$H = \\frac{B}{D_c} - \\frac{k}{\\sigma}$$ ^ZBlaLBaW9\n\nInitially, $$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\dot\\tau_r} \\tag{8}$$ where $\\tau_r$ is the reference shear stress. $\\gamma$ is a state variable that evolves with time and stressing history. Essentially, the seismicity rate is controlled only by the stressing rate.\n\nThe state variable evolves with time as\n\n$$d\\gamma = \\frac{1}{A\\sigma}[dt - \\gamma d\\tau + \\gamma(\\frac{\\tau}{\\sigma} - \\alpha)d\\sigma] \\tag{9}$$ ^Dieterich1994-9\n\n- The steady-state solution goes back to (8)\n- $A$ generally has values between 0.005-0.012 ^jN7GXVW6b\n- These equations reproduce Omori's law of aftershock decay with 1/time.\n- At steady state\n$$\\gamma_{ss} = \\frac{1}{\\dot\\tau}; t_a = \\frac{A\\sigma}{\\dot\\tau} \\tag{10}$$\n- Seismicity rate $R = \\frac{r}{\\gamma\\dot\\tau_r}$. $r$ is the reference seismicity rate.

Through much of this belt, the topography is created and controlled by fault movement in earthquakes. Many habitations are located at the foot of the fault-controlled mountain range-fronts that bound inhospitable deserts or elevated plateaus, in positions that are favourable for trade-routes, strategic control of access or for water supply. As a result, they are vulnerable to earthquakes, which often seem to have targeted population centres precisely.\n\nFor many centuries, an uneasy accommodation was reached between human needs and the earthquake-controlled landscape, sometimes brilliantly exploited by local hydrological engineering, as in Iran. Occasional earthquakes would occur, killing a shocking proportion of the population, but the populations of the settlements themselves would be relatively small. Many once-small rural communities have now grown into towns, cities or megacities, while retaining their vulnerability through poor building standards. Earthquakes that occur in these places today now kill many more than they did in the past, as we have witnessed in the last few years. Extreme catastrophes have been rare only because the exposure of modern megacities to earthquake hazards has been relatively short (approx. 50 years); an increase in the number of such catastrophes now seems to be inevitable.\n\n## See also\n[[notes/EMME23|EMME]]","lastmodified":"2022-08-01T15:31:44.510932866Z","tags":null},"/notes/James-H-Dieterich":{"title":"James H Dieterich","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-08-01T15:31:44.510932866Z","tags":null},"/notes/Making-a-github-hosted-website":{"title":"Making a github-hosted website","content":"\nI use Jekyll for static-site generation, combining with Atom for git and Obsidian for writing.

Turned out if you can fix the projection, you are half-way there. The projection is handled by [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html).\n\n# Cartopy\n## projection\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\n\n# Choosing a projection here\nproj = ccrs.Mercator(central_longitude=Catalog.Longitude.mean())\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=[8, 8])\n# And set the projection of the axis\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection=proj)\nax.set_extent([165.5, 175.1, -47.5, -40], crs=ccrs.PlateCarree(proj))\ngrd = ax.gridlines(draw_labels=True)\ns = ax.scatter(Catalog.Longitude, Catalog.Latitude, marker='o',\n               s=Catalog.Magnitude**2, edgecolor='k', facecolor='none',\n               transform=ccrs.Geodetic())\nplt.show()\n```\n\nCartopy also provide basemap tiling from available data providers like Stamen Design.\n\n## Text clipping\n```python\nt = ax.text(-131, 40,'a string', clip_on=True, transform=ccrs.PlateCarree())\nt.clipbox = ax.bbox\n```\n\n# Maps with geopandas\n[Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) is great in that I don't need to fire up any GIS software to extract the spatial information from an shapefile. And the dataframe is ready to use just as in pandas.\n\n- Making a geopandas dataframe from [[notes/Pandas|Pandas]] dataframe\n```python\ngdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geopandas.points_from_xy(df.Longitude, df.Latitude))\n```\n\n- It is also easy to transform the shapes to different projections.

Loosely, PKM tools are referred to the note keeping apps that let you reference portions of the note I happened to try the famed web-based note service *Roam Research*. Roam is a \"outliner\", bit like *Workflowy* or *Dynalist*.  One writes in hierarchical bullet points, or outlines. This structure allows you to write in a more non-linear way. Each page and bullet has its own address and can be easily cited elsewhere. There are open-sourced alternatives that achieve similar noting experience: [Athens Research](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens) and [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq). Personally, I use Athens Research for my daily scribbles. Now switching to RemNote for better PDF integration.\n\nUsing these tools free me from the note black hole that is Evernote or random note pile that is Bear and allows me to recycle and cite my own note to write more. The blocks also nudge you to write freely without considering too much about structures. That you can drag and drop later. These advantages are great, but the underlying data structure makes the content a bit harder to transfer between tools, say Google Doc or Overleaf.\n\nInstead of outliners, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a program for connected notes written and stored as plain-text markdown files. Although more traditional in writing experience like other plain-text editors, The transferable file format makes it easy to integrate with a [[notes/Making a github-hosted website|static website]] like this one and a lot other tools like pandoc, R, Jupyter notebook, etc. And since static website generators like Jekyll and Hugo take markdown files, Obsidian is also great for writing website posts like this.","lastmodified":"2022-08-01T15:31:44.510932866Z","tags":null},"/notes/PSHA":{"title":"Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment","content":"\n# Components\n## Source models\n\n## Ground motion models\n\n## Uncertainty model\n\n\n# See also\n[[notes/UCERF|UCERF]]\n\n# Resources\n- [[notes/Gerstenberger.RevGeophys.2020]]\n- [Fault2SHA learning series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEI-hzEOFRsMdQFdRPS1XBg) on youtube\n- The [[notes/OpenQuake|OpenQuake]] engine by GEM (Global Earthquake Model Foundation)","lastmodified":"2022-08-01T15:31:44.510932866Z","tags":null},"/notes/Pandas":{"title":"Pandas","content":"\nI am unable to leave pandas because I work with catalogs.

Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

Surely one can use the statistics to generate one. But we know plates move and faults slide. How do we incorporate these information when generating sequences?\n\nThe statistical route of generating synthetic seismicity is using the [ETAS](notes/ETAS.md) (epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model. ETAS relies on the scaling-law parameters that are fitted to real catalogs. Another more physical route is the cellular automata models commonly called the earthquake simulators. The earthquake simulators takes the fault geometries as the model mesh and simulate patch sliding and interactions just like what we imagine earthquakes do. Because the failure criterion is as simple as on-off switches, these models are very efficient for models with large degrees of freedom and a long simulated period. Better still, the event generated reproduce the power-law magnitude distribution seen in earthquake catalogs. But because the failure mechanisms are simple, the simulators do not recover the details of nucleation, propagation and finally arrest. The models that can do so solves the conservation equations using various numerical methods. These class of models are capable to reproduce rupture processes and even ground motions. However, they are computationally demanding, especially for multiple earthquake cycles. \n\nIs there a way for us greedy scientists to have both phenomena in one simulation? A model that solves the differential equations but also produces diverse events that compose frequency-magnitude distribution? In this project we achieve such simulations using appropriate frictional parameters, fault interactions, and a suitable solver to vastly improve the time-stepping efficiency. The result is a simple fault system that generate diverse earthquake sequence.\n\n![](notes/images/pap2_tweet.gif)\n\nOur result shows that with fault interaction that naturally exists within the crust, it's a lot easier to generate earthquake sequences that look like real sequences, at least from the statistic angle. There are other factors we have yet to put in the model, such as heterogeneous frictional properties and non-planar fault planes. The result gives us chances to exam the effect of all these factors that create the statistical signatures of seismicity as we know it.\n\n## Preprint\n**Yifan Yin**, Percy Galvez, Elías R.

Does the uneven deformation affect the seismicity as well? Through theory, we know a change of stress will also change the earthquake productivity. To amplify the statistical significance of rate-change estimate from a sparsely instrumented region, we use the [template matching](notes/template%20matching.md) technique to discover small earthquakes that didn't reach the network detection threshold. Because there are few stations to constrain the detection quality, we add another layer of safety using a simple supervised learning method, [the support vector machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), to tease out false detections.\n\n![](notes/images/cumu_dila4.jpg)\n\nWe found that in the seismicity rate change positively correlate with the coseismic strain produced by the Dusky Sound earthquake. The NS extension slow down the earthquake productivity, likely also unclamp the EW Darfield rupture. The effect of strain field changing during the subduction zone events has large impact in low-strain area like the Canterbury Plain. And monitoring microseismicity would be a great complement of available geophysical measurements.\n\n\n## Publication\n**Yifan Yin**, Stefan Wiemer, Edi Kissling, Federica Lanza, Antonio P.

It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration. Operand needs access to GitHub in order to index your digital garden properly!\n4. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar and select 'Create Collection'.\n\t1. Set the 'Collection Label' to something that will help you remember it.\n\t2. You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2. Set the 'Interface Type' to `object-search` and click 'Create'.\n\t3. This will bring you to a new page with a search bar. Ignore this for now.\n6. Go back to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API Keys and find your Quartz-specific Operand API key under 'Other keys'.\n\t1. Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2022-08-01T15:31:44.522932942Z","tags":null},"/notes/setup":{"title":"Setup","content":"\n## Making your own Quartz\nSetting up Quartz requires a basic understanding of `git`. If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat! Now you have everything you need to start editing and growing your digital garden. If you're ready to start writing content already, check out the recommended flow for editing notes in Quartz.\n\n\u003e ✏️ Step 2: [Editing Notes in Quartz](notes/editing.md)\n\nHaving problems?

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)","lastmodified":"2022-08-01T15:31:44.522932942Z","tags":null},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
