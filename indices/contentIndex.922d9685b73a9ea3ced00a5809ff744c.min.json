Res. Lett.]]\n- [Source code](https://github.com/tomchartier/SHERIFS)\n\n## Abstract\n- Modeling the seismic potential of active faults and their associated epistemic uncertainties is a fundamental step of [probabilistic seismic hazard assessment](../research/probabilistic seismic hazard assessment.md) (PSHA). Seismic hazard and earthquake rate in fault systems (SHERIFS) is an open‐source python code that builds hazard models including earthquake ruptures involving several fault sections or fault‐to‐fault (FtF) ruptures. It contains user‐friendly tools to calculate the annual rate of FtF ruptures in a fault system based on the slip‐rate estimates and accounting for associated background seismicity.\n- SHERIFS applies a forward incremental approach following three rules: \n    - (1) the FtF ruptures allowed in the fault system are defined as input by the user and explored randomly, \n    - (2) the magnitude–frequency distribution of the modeled seismicity in the fault system must follow an imposed shape, and \n    - (3) the slip‐rate budget attributed to each fault section must be preserved in the calculation if the first two rules allow it. \n- Indeed, in some cases, a fraction of the slip‐rate budget must be considered as being spent in non‐mainshock events such as creep or postseismic slip. Background seismicity rates are defined by the hazard modeler as the ratio of seismicity occurring on the modelled faults for different ranges of magnitude.\n- Given a coherent set of input hypotheses, SHERIFS allows end users to build the seismic‐hazard fault model thanks to an interactive user‐friendly interface. It aims to help interactions between field data collectors and hazard modelers to explore and weight epistemic uncertainties affecting the input hypotheses. To do so, SHERIFS includes tools to compare modeled earthquake rates with the available local data (earthquake catalog and paleoseismological data). This comparison can be used to weigh different hypotheses explored in a logic tree and discard the hypotheses that are not in agreement with the data. SHERIFS’s outputs are in a format that can be used directly as inputs for PSHA in the OpenQuake engine ([[Pagani.SRL.2014.OpenQuake]]).\n\n \n## Highlights\n### Page 01\n- Each modeler has a different approach for translating slip rates into earthquake rates on faults which sometimes does not allow a straightforward understanding of the resulting hazard model\n- Thus, in most hazard models (e.g., Woessner et al. , 2015 ; Taiwan Earthquake Model [TEM], Wang et al. , 2016 ), small faults are usually grouped into large structures to allow for larger magnitude earthquakes\n- background earthquakes are handled using a truncated approach in which earthquakes with a magnitude lower or equal to M w 6.4 occur only in the back- ground zone with a rate defined by the rate in the earthquake catalog, whereas magnitudes higher than M w 6.4 are located on the faults with a rate defined using the average slip rate of the fault\n### Page 02\n- modeling procedures to allow a large set of possible FtF ruptures to occur in an aleatory fashion in the hazard model while reflecting the individual slip rate of each section\n- The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast version 3 (UCERF3, Field et al. , 2014 ) tackles this issue and allows FtF ruptures to occur in the model by relaxing the segmentation assumption and treating the problem at the faults system level\n- In this article, we propose an alternative approach to calculate the earthquake rates in a fault system, which preserves the main philosophy of UCERF3.\n- This methodology requires as input data fault section geometries and slip-rate estimates for all the faults of the fault system to calculate the earthquake rupture rates\n- The SHERIFS iterative methodology requires first ==establishing possible FtF earthquake rupture scenarios in the fault system and fixing the shape of the target MFD for the entire fault system==.\n- At the beginning of the iterative process, the absolute value of the target MFD is not known, only the **shape** is imposed\n### Page 03\n- Faults with a longer length should be cut in smaller sections (that can rupture together). The sections should be defined as small as necessary to account for local information. For example, a change in slip rate, rake, or dip should be considered for defining the sections.\n### Page 04\n- In SHERIFS, the MFD for the whole system has been defined to follow a target shape\n- SHERIFS workflow includes three tools that should be used sequentially (Fig. 2 ). The first tool sets up and runs the SHERIFS calculation, and the logic tree exploring the episte- mic uncertainties with the help of a graphical interface. The second tool allows visualizing the hazard model and comparing the modeled earthquake rates with available data. After a critical analysis of this comparison, the third tool allows the end- user setting the weights of the logic-tree branches. The final outputs can then be directly used to perform PSHA.\n### Page 11\n- MATLAB tools to turn fault data into seismic-hazard models\n\n## Notes\n- Seismic Hazard and Earthquake Rates In Fault Systems\n- Adapt the main philosophy of [[notes/UCERF3|UCERF3]]\n\n### Inputs\n- Fault geometry and basic descriptions\n- Target [[statistical seismology#Magnitude-frequency distribution|magnitude-frequency distribution]] shape of fault seismicity\n    - This is expressed as the **ratio** of magnitudes occurring in the background hypothesis input.\n\n## See also\n[[notes/Pace-SRL-2016-FiSH]]\n[[Chartier.NHESS.2017]]\n[[@Visini2020-dr]]\n[[GeoJSON]]\n\n# Alternative models\n[[@Visini2020-dr#SUNFiSH|SUNFiSH]] that grew out of [[@Pace2016-wb|FiSH]].

The objective is to find the time at which each source in the population initiates an earthquake by following the evolution of conditions on the sources when subjected to some stressing history.\n   - Here the volume containing the sources is assumed to be small enough to undergo the same stressing history.\n   - The time of nucleation $t = F[C, \\tau(t)]$. C is the initial condition and $\\tau(t)$ is the stressing history.\n   - At each time step, C is reevaluated using the prior stressing history and the state distribution.\n\nAssume the initial condition is under a reference constant stressing rate $\\dot\\tau_r$ and generate constant seismicity rate $r$\n- The time when $n^{th}$ event occur: $$t = n/r = F[C, \\tau_r] \\tag{1;2}$$\n- So, $C = C(n, r, \\dot\\tau_r)$ (3)\n- and $t = F[C(n, r, \\dot\\tau_r), \\tau(t)]$ (4)\n\n### Rate-and-state friction incoming\n- [[notes/Dieterich-Tectonophysics-1992|Dieterich1992]]\n- Link the [[notes/rate-and-state friction|rate-and-state friction]] using $\\tau$\n\n$$\\tau=\\sigma[\\mu_0+A\\ln(\\frac{\\dot\\sigma}{\\dot\\sigma^*})+ B_1\\ln(\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta^*_1})+B_2\\ln(\\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta^*_2})+...] \\tag{5}$$\n\n$$d\\theta_i = [\\frac{1}{\\dot\\delta} - \\frac{\\theta_i}{Dc}]d\\sigma - [\\frac{\\alpha_i\\theta_i}{B_i\\sigma}]d\\sigma$$\n\nState change with 1. aging law and 2. normal stress law from Linker and Dieterich, 1992.\n\n## Appendix A: Earthquake nucleation\nThe author reiterates the $L_c$ and said empirical evaluation of the size of the nucleation zone from the numerical models gives $\\xi$ ~ 0.4B.\n\nSimulations of faults with heterogeneous properties show that:\n- The zone of most rapid acceleration tends to shrink to a characteristic fault length of $L_c$ (Appendix A, equation (A2)) as the time of instability approaches.\n- Nucleation sources of length $L_c$ develop spontaneously in regions where the shear stress relative to the sliding resistance averaged over $L_c$ is higher than the surroundings.\n\nIn general, slip speed is determined by the independent variables $\\theta$, $\\tau$, and $\\sigma$. It is shown in Appendix A that in an accelerating slip patch evolution of $\\theta$ is determined by slip. Under this condition, the dependence of the time to instability on initial conditions is fully specified by the initial slip speed ${\\dot\\delta}_0$ of the patch (Appendix A, equation (A7)).\n\n$$\\dot\\delta_0 = (\\theta_{o_1}^{-B_1/A}\\theta_{o_2}^{-B2/A}...)exp(\\frac{\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\sigma}-\\mu'_0}{A}) \\tag{A7}$$\n\nThe distribution of initial slip speed is (7).

We can only make very coarse forecast not because we do not know the physics, but because the direct measurements of the key physical properties are impossible. Comparing to weather systems, one can measure the temperature, pressure and water content in the atmosphere. One can see the cloud cover and even methane and ozone.  The atmosphere is continuous and can be modeled using continuous PDEs. However, we can not see the stress and strain field underground. The elastic property and fluid content can only be measured using indirect methods.  We don’t even know where all the faults are. We can only know the partial history of seismic events if they leave geological marks or historical accounts.\n- The 2014 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP 2014) put out perhaps the most comprehensive earthquake model to date. The Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast version 3 ([[notes/UCERF3|UCERF3]]) contains four sub-components but can be split into two: the time-independent models ([[Field.BSSA.2014]]) and the time-dependent models ([Field et al., 2015](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article/105/2A/511-543/331850)).\n- The time-independent models sum up the geological and geodetic data that describe the fault geometries and slip velocities, and earthquake rate models inverted from the former constraints.\n- The (long-term) time-dependent part then gives the probabilities of all possible ruptures based on the PDF of renewal models by taking in the historical and paleo-seismology results.  The results can then be aggregated for specific faults or time period. Although dubbed “time-dependent”, the model has a horizon of decades and is built for risk assessment such as building codes and insurances.\n- For the short-term forecasts, WGCEP published the UCERF3-ETAS model ([Field et al., 2017](http://www.bssaonline.org/lookup/doi/10.1785/0120160173)) aiming to have a forecast period from days to decades, aka. Operational earthquake forecasting.  [[notes/ETAS|ETAS]] model treats every event as a seed to trigger more events, thus the name “epidemic”. The distribution of the events generated follows a generalization of Omori-Utsu low of aftershock generation. It is in a way close to the data assimilation concept as the current catalog can serve as the input and swath of forecasts can provide the forecasting probabilities. By combining the UCERF3 with ETAS, it is able to generate synthetic catalogs that obey various constraints posed by the UCERF3-TD model.\n- However, the workaround UCERF3-ETAS did in order to make the probabilities resemble elastic rebound triggering will be straight-forward using the physics-based simulator along with some form of stochastic modeling. There are two components that the present physics-based simulators can not cover. First, physics-based models can not achieve is producing background seismicity, or “off-fault seismicity” as defined in UCERF3. ([Robinson et al., 2011](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.05161.x)) attempted to address this by putting small random faults in the half-space to produce off-fault seismicity that subjected to Coulomb stress change. Second, a physics-based simulator provides mainly long-term hazard analysis, mainly because the minimum magnitudes it reaches for regional scale is much larger than the network resolution. Only the return periods of large (M\u003e=7, for example) on-fault earthquakes are used in hazard analysis.\n\n# Can physics-based [[earthquake simulator]] help more?\n- Yes, and it should. Until a full 3-D continuum model ([Dal Zilio et al., 2018](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X17306210)) become feasible for a crustal fault system, the boundary-element models are the best simulation tool we have for seismicity evolution.  Models are made to predict. But so far, the input for the earthquake simulator only contains boundary conditions.  The time series they produce are only of statistical value. In other words, researchers compress the temporal evolution of the seismicity into distributions of return periods, MFD, etc. and only extract the PDF out of them. But in [[notes/earthquake simulator#Virtual Quake|Virtual Quake]], at least, the seismicity is exact when one fixes the input stress field. If so, can we invert for the initial given the time series?\n\n# Conventional \"physics-based\" earthquake forecasting\n- Usually it is a combination of [Coulomb Stress](../../research/Coulomb Stress.md) changes plus the seismicity change derived by [Dieterich.JGR.1994.stress2rate](../../reference/Dieterich.JGR.1994.stress2rate.md). \n- Still people in 2021 [Hardebeck.JGR.2021](../../reference/Hardebeck.JGR.2021.md) think this is physics-based and it is crap comparing to [Epidemic-Type Aftershocks Sequence](../../research/Epidemic-Type Aftershocks Sequence.md).\n- \"Deep catalogs\" using  greatly enhance the event number.

Through much of this belt, the topography is created and controlled by fault movement in earthquakes. Many habitations are located at the foot of the fault-controlled mountain range-fronts that bound inhospitable deserts or elevated plateaus, in positions that are favourable for trade-routes, strategic control of access or for water supply. As a result, they are vulnerable to earthquakes, which often seem to have targeted population centres precisely.\n\nFor many centuries, an uneasy accommodation was reached between human needs and the earthquake-controlled landscape, sometimes brilliantly exploited by local hydrological engineering, as in Iran. Occasional earthquakes would occur, killing a shocking proportion of the population, but the populations of the settlements themselves would be relatively small. Many once-small rural communities have now grown into towns, cities or megacities, while retaining their vulnerability through poor building standards. Earthquakes that occur in these places today now kill many more than they did in the past, as we have witnessed in the last few years. Extreme catastrophes have been rare only because the exposure of modern megacities to earthquake hazards has been relatively short (approx. 50 years); an increase in the number of such catastrophes now seems to be inevitable.\n\n## See also\n[[notes/prj-EMME23|EMME]]","lastmodified":"2023-01-16T17:13:00.527012389Z","tags":null},"/notes/James-H-Dieterich":{"title":"James H.

Loosely, PKM tools are referred to the note keeping apps that let you reference portions of the note I happened to try the famed web-based note service *Roam Research*. Roam is a \"outliner\", bit like *Workflowy* or *Dynalist*.  One writes in hierarchical bullet points, or outlines. This structure allows you to write in a more non-linear way. Each page and bullet has its own address and can be easily cited elsewhere. There are open-sourced alternatives that achieve similar noting experience: [Athens Research](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens) and [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq). Personally, I used Athens Research for my daily scribbles. Now I switch to [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com/) for better PDF integration.\n\nUsing these tools free me from the note black hole that is Evernote or random note pile that is Bear and allows me to recycle and cite my own note to write more. The blocks also nudge you to write freely without considering too much about structures. That you can drag and drop later. These advantages are great, but the underlying data structure makes the content a bit harder to transfer between tools, say Google Doc or Overleaf.\n\nInstead of outliners, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a program for connected notes written and stored as plain-text markdown files. Although more traditional in writing experience like other plain-text editors, The transferable file format makes it easy to integrate with a [[notes/Making a github-hosted website|static website]] like this one and a lot other tools like pandoc, R, Jupyter notebook, etc. And since static website generators like Jekyll and Hugo take markdown files, Obsidian is also great for writing website posts like this.","lastmodified":"2023-01-16T17:13:00.527012389Z","tags":null},"/notes/PSHA":{"title":"Probabilistic seismic hazard assessment","content":"\n# Basic\n- Large-magnitude earthquakes dominant the risk but are the most difficult to constrain\n\n# Components\n## Source models\nBest talk from the Fault2SHA channel by Graeme Weatherill\n\u003ciframe width=\"360\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oliQ22qc41Q\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Ground motion models\n\n## Uncertainty model\n\n# See also\n[notes/UCERF3|UCERF3]]\n\n# Resources\n- [[notes/Gerstenberger-RevGeophys-2020|Gerstenberger2020]]\n- [Fault2SHA learning series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEI-hzEOFRsMdQFdRPS1XBg) on youtube\n- The [[OpenQuake|OpenQuake]] engine by GEM (Global Earthquake Model Foundation)","lastmodified":"2023-01-16T17:13:00.527012389Z","tags":null},"/notes/Pace-SRL-2016-FiSH":{"title":"Pace-SRL-2016-FiSH","content":"\n# FiSH: MATLAB Tools to Turn Fault Data into Seismic‐Hazard Models\n- Authors: B Pace, F Visini and L Peruzza\n-","lastmodified":"2023-01-16T17:13:00.527012389Z","tags":null},"/notes/Pace2016-wb":{"title":"FiSH: MATLAB tools to turn fault data into Seismic‐Hazard models","content":"\n# FiSH: MATLAB tools to turn fault data into Seismic‐Hazard models\nAuthors:: [[Bruno Pace]], [[Francesco Visini]], and L Peruzza\nDate:: 2016\nSource:: [[Seismol.

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

Turned out if you can fix the projection, you are half-way there. The projection is handled by [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/index.html).\n\n# Pyproj\nPython interface for the PROJ library. Can perform geodetic (great circle) calculation given a projection. For example:\n- `pyproj.Geod.fwd()` compute the (lon, lat) given initial (lon, lat), distance and azimuth.\n- `pyproj.Geod.inv()`\n\n# Cartopy\n## projection\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport cartopy.crs as ccrs\n\n# Choosing a projection here\nproj = ccrs.Mercator(central_longitude=Catalog.Longitude.mean())\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=[8, 8])\n# And set the projection of the axis\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection=proj)\nax.set_extent([165.5, 175.1, -47.5, -40], crs=ccrs.PlateCarree(proj))\ngrd = ax.gridlines(draw_labels=True)\ns = ax.scatter(Catalog.Longitude, Catalog.Latitude, marker='o',\n               s=Catalog.Magnitude**2, edgecolor='k', facecolor='none',\n               transform=ccrs.Geodetic())\nplt.show()\n```\n\nCartopy also provide basemap tiling from available data providers like Stamen Design.\n\n## Text clipping\n```python\nt = ax.text(-131, 40,'a string', clip_on=True, transform=ccrs.PlateCarree())\nt.clipbox = ax.bbox\n```\n\n# Geopandas\n[Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/) is great in that I don't need to fire up any GIS software to extract the spatial information from an shapefile. And the dataframe is ready to use just as in pandas.\n\n## Making a geopandas dataframe from [[notes/Pandas|Pandas]] dataframe ([ref](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/gallery/create_geopandas_from_pandas.html))\n- From longitude-latitude pairs\n```python\ngdf = geopandas.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=geopandas.points_from_xy(df.Longitude, df.Latitude))\n```\n\n- It is also easy to transform the shapes to different projections.

In a programming sense, it describes a model where parallel tasks all have the same \"picture\" of memory and can directly address and access the same logical memory locations regardless of where the physical memory actually exists.\n\n### Uniform Memory Access (UMA)\n- **Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP)** machines with Identical processors and equal access and access times to memory\n- Cache coherent\n\n### Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)\n- Often made by physically linking two or more SMPs\n- One SMP can directly access memory of another SMP\n- When more SMPs exist, the geometrically increasing linkage becomes harder to manage.\n\n## Distributed memory\n- No global address space known to individual processors\n- No cache coherency\n- When a processor needs access to data in another processor, it is usually the task of the programmer to explicitly define how and when data is communicated. Synchronization between tasks is likewise the programmer's responsibility.\n\n### Advantages\n- Memory is scalable with the number of processors. Increase the number of processors and the size of memory increases proportionately.\n- Each processor can rapidly access its own memory without interference and without the overhead incurred with trying to maintain global cache coherency.\n- Cost effectiveness: can use commodity, off-the-shelf processors and networking.\n\n### Disadvantages\n- The programmer is responsible for many of the details associated with data communication between processors.\n- It may be difficult to map existing data structures, based on global memory, to this memory organization.\n- Non-uniform memory access times: data residing on a remote node takes longer to access than node local data.\n\nMost of the clusters today are combinations of shared-memory machines networked together as a distributed memory system.

This requires synchronization constructs to ensure that more than one thread is not updating the same global address at any time.\n- Threads can come and go, but **a.out** remains present to provide the necessary shared resources until the application has completed.\n- Threading is good for IO-bound calculation (in python with GIL)\n- POSIX Threads\n    - Or Pthreads\n    - C only\n- [[OpenMP]]\n- Other threaded implementations \n    - Microsoft threads\n    - Java, [[python]] threads\n    - CUDA threads for GPUs\n## Distributed Memory / Message Passing Model\n- A set of tasks that use their own local memory during computation.

For example, a send operation must have a matching receive operation.\n- \n## Data Parallel Model\n## Hybrid Model\n- MPI between nodes and OpenMP within nodes\n- Another similar and increasingly popular example of a hybrid model is using MPI with CPU-GPU (graphics processing unit) programming.\n    - MPI tasks run on CPUs using local memory and communicating with each other over a network.\n    - Computationally intensive kernels are off-loaded to GPUs on-node.\n    - Data exchange between node-local memory and GPUs uses [[CUDA]] (or something equivalent).\n\n# Designing parallel programs\n- Automatic parallelization\n    - Done by compilers, mostly on loops.\n- Manually using compiler directives\n- Understand the problem and the program\n    - hotspots that require the most calculation\n    - bottlenecks that slow down the wall time\n        - IO\n    - Inhibitors of parallelizing\n        - data dependence\n        - Investigate other algorithms if possible.

Surely one can use the statistics to generate one. But we know plates move and faults slide. How do we incorporate these information when generating sequences?\n\nThe statistical route of generating synthetic seismicity is using the [[notes/ETAS|ETAS]] (epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model. ETAS relies on the scaling-law parameters that are fitted to real catalogs. Another more physical route is the cellular automata models commonly called the earthquake simulators. The earthquake simulators takes the fault geometries as the model mesh and simulate patch sliding and interactions just like what we imagine earthquakes do. Because the failure criterion is as simple as on-off switches, these models are very efficient for models with large degrees of freedom and a long simulated period. Better still, the event generated reproduce the power-law magnitude distribution seen in earthquake catalogs. But because the failure mechanisms are simple, the simulators do not recover the details of nucleation, propagation and finally arrest. The models that can do so solves the conservation equations using various numerical methods. These class of models are capable to reproduce rupture processes and even ground motions. However, they are computationally demanding, especially for multiple earthquake cycles. \n\nIs there a way for us greedy scientists to have both phenomena in one simulation? A model that solves the differential equations but also produces diverse events that compose frequency-magnitude distribution? In this project we achieve such simulations using appropriate frictional parameters, fault interactions, and a suitable solver to vastly improve the time-stepping efficiency of [[main/QDYN|QDYN]], a rupture simulator. The result is a simple fault system that generate diverse earthquake sequence.\n\n![](notes/images/pap2_tweet.gif)\n\nOur result shows that with fault interaction that naturally exists within the crust, it's a lot easier to generate earthquake sequences that resemble real sequences, albeit that the maximum magnitude is bounded by the fault size. There are other factors we have yet to put in the model, such as heterogeneous frictional properties and non-planar fault planes. The result gives us chances to exam the effect of all these factors that create the statistical signatures of seismicity as we know it.\n\n# Perspectives\n- What does the distribution look like for seismicity generated on the same fault?

Both seismicity and geodetic data are readily available to us. But how does one translate to another?\n\nIn this project, we investigate if the subduction-zone events disturb the seismicity in three  region prior to the Canterbury earthquake sequence starting in 2010, in the South Island of New Zealand. The 2009 M7.8 [Dusky Sound earthquake](https://www.geonet.org.nz/earthquake/story/3124785) is a subduction-zone event that deform large part of the South Island. Its coseismic slip and afterslip left profound footprint in the strain field on the South Island. \n\nThe strain field we resolve is not smooth at all. Does the uneven deformation affect the seismicity as well? Through theory, we know a change of stress will also change the earthquake productivity. To amplify the statistical significance of rate-change estimate from a sparsely instrumented region, we use the [[notes/template matching|template matching]] technique to discover small earthquakes that didn't reach the network detection threshold. Because there are few stations to constrain the detection quality, we add another layer of safety using a simple supervised learning method, [the support vector machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), to tease out false detections.\n\n![](notes/images/cumu_dila4.jpg)\n\nWe found that in the seismicity rate change positively correlate with the coseismic strain produced by the Dusky Sound earthquake. The NS extension slow down the earthquake productivity, likely also unclamp the EW Darfield rupture. The effect of strain field changing during the subduction zone events has large impact in low-strain area like the Canterbury Plain.
