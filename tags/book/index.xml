Notes The calculus you need Video
At the end, a useful formula in differential equations is confirmed by the product rule, the derivative of $e^x$, and the fundamental theorem of calculus (4) The key step in scientific computing is improving first order accuracy (forward differences) to second order accuracy (centered differences).</description></item><item><title>Guns, germs and steel</title><link>https://yifanyin.github.io/notes/Guns-germs-and-steel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yifanyin.github.io/notes/Guns-germs-and-steel/</guid><description>Guns, germs and steel Authors:: [[Jared Diamond]] Source:: Amazon Date:: [[2021-01-01 Fri]] Links:: #history #anthropology Notes The big mammals in Africa likely evolve with the proto-humans so that they are not killed off.</description></item><item><title>How to take smart notes</title><link>https://yifanyin.github.io/notes/How-to-take-smart-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yifanyin.github.io/notes/How-to-take-smart-notes/</guid><description>Metadata Author:: Sönke Ahrens Source:: Kindle
The book every #PKM tool talk about, Roam Research and [[Obsidian]] alike.
Things one should do Make fleeting notes Make literature notes Make permanent notes keep taking notes and keeping track of them will help you review ones work constantly, avoiding the big and scary review in the end.</description></item></channel></rss>
